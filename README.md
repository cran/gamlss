# gamlss: Generalized Additive Models for Location Scale and Shape

Functions for fitting the Generalized Additive Models for Location Scale and Shape introduced by
[Rigby and Stasinopoulos (2005)](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-9876.2005.00510.x).
The models use a distributional regression approach where all the parameters of the conditional
distribution of the response variable are modelled using explanatory variables.
