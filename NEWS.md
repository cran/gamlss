# Introduction

gamlss is a R package implementing the Generalised Additive Models for
 The package `gamlss` is an implementation of  Rigby and Stasinopoulos (2005),  Appl. Statist., 54,  pp. 507-554.

There are three book available for information; 

 1) "Flexible Regression and Smoothing: Using GAMLSS in R" 
explaining how the models can be used in R.

2) 
"Distributions for modeling location, scale and shape: Using GAMLSS in R" 
explaining the explicit and generated distributions available in the 
package gamlss.dist  

3)  
"Generized Additive Models for Location Scale and Shape: A distributional 
regression  approach with applications" 
explaining the different method for fitting GAMLSS i.e. penalised Likelihood, Bayesian and Boosting.

The GitHub repository is now hosted under the new `gamlss-dev` organization:

# Version 5.4-21

* `predict()` do not  print the message "new prediction"

* `stepGAIC()` produce less lines in the output 




# Version 5.4-20

* The package is now hosted on GitHub at
  <https://github.com/gamlss-dev/gamlss/>.

* Add a new `prodist()` method for extracting fitted (in-sample) or predicted
  (out-of-sample) probability distributions from gamlss models (contributed by
  [Achim Zeileis](https://www.zeileis.org/)). This enables the workflow from the
  [distributions3](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=distributions3) package for all
  distributions provided by `gamlss.dist`. The idea is that the `distributions3`
  objects encapsulate all information needed to obtain moments (mean, variance,
  etc.), probabilities, quantiles, etc. with a unified interface. See the
  [useR! 2022 presentation](https://www.zeileis.org/news/user2022/) by
  Zeileis, Lang, and Hayes for an overview.
